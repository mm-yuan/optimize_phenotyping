### A) Construction of a feature space via dimensionality reduction to capture wide-ranging shape variation. B) Identification of genetically relevant directions within this feature space through a genetic search algorithm. C) Evaluation of the genetic relevance of the proposed heritability-enriched and commingling-based skewed phenotypes in GWAS and RVAS.
